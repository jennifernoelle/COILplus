This folder contains the code to replicate the analysis in the manuscript, 
including all species names. 

# TO do:
  # Strip species names in first file instead of after creating obs_A
  # Copy results into pub folder and rename to test plotting code
  # Test analysis code by 
    # running v short
    # running paper version
    # running version with more thinning for better mixing to potentially add to a revision?

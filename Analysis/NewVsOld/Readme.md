I created this new repo using the public repo as a template because the old one had too much junk in it
Use this version to work on the blocked sampler
The runs using the old sampler MO can be copied here
But the new sampler MO versions had the wrong sampler in them, need to be rerun
First step is working on the blocked sampler



Information for final runs

- No pseudoabsences: Pseudoabsence results did not make sense: for example heldout pseudo-absences had a higher posterior mean than overall. This likely results from a lack of good pseduo-absences in the dataset. Only around 20 observations had 3 or more repeated non-edges, and it may be that these were due to seasonality (e.g. not fruiting at the time) rather than true non-interactions. Hence, pseudo-absences will be omitted from final runs. 
- No baboons or baboon-only plants
- New sampler: There seem to be marginal benefits to the new sampler, so we will include it in the increased runs
- Number of iterations, replications etc: 
- Scenarios: Default 0/1, Defualt 0.5/1, Default 0.75/1, Exp1mod - all with and without the prior
- Additionally, do some short runs to verify that Exp1mod beats the other scenarios
- Do we want posterior networks for all scenarios? Or just the one that has the best cv results?

    
- To do: 
  - Add and organize blocked sampler functions - even though we don't use these, good to save here
  - Run demos with blocked sampler functions and save plots to show David
  - Update MCMC function to have an option to sample occurrence probs or not
  - X Make sure the preliminary results can be plotted and look good
  - X If yes, then update all of the .sh files to use the same settings
  - CV RUNS: including the best expert from the preliminary results
    - X Note that old_p75 needs to be rerun because it was initially run on too few iterations
    - X Double check that all other runs had the right number of iterations
    - Status: Adding p99 and p1 scenarios for context, rerunning old models due to error in 'detect'
    - X Extract preliminary posterior networks from CV analysis and review
  - "Final runs": run the best models without CV for post network and trait matching
    - Status: 
        - newp75 first seed failed to save properly (use the "more output" results)
        - newmod1 was terminated and started over: us either it or the more output result, depending on which finishes first
        - rerunning the old models due to error in 'detect' - but using MO version
    - Save the posterior interaction matrices and heatmaps, number of new pairs
    - How different are the resulting posterior interaction matrices
    - How different are the occurrence probabilities in the new sampler vs old sampler
      - Note: in the old sampler, we sample occurrence, not occurrence probabilities - we could make it return mean of the occurrence indicator?
    - How many scenarios should Camille actually include
    - Note: new sampler code not currently returning occurrences
      - X Update new code to return running mean plant occurrence probabilities and occurrences
      - X Update old code to return running mean of plant occurrence indicators
      - X Create new batch files to run for the four best scenarios
      - Status: running. Note this does not need to be done before Camille can rerun defaunation simulations
        - Restarted old models MO version due to error in 'detect' in the original function
        - Restarted old models MO version for 1/0.75 because O_P not updating
        - Need to rerun CV now
      
  - Run even longer final runs: mixing isn't great
    - Modify code to return only running mean of L's
    - Note: mixing is better using the fixed occurrence probabilities vs expert scenarios (at least in old model)
  - Run trait matching
    - Update code

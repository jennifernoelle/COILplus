This folder contains modified helper scripts in development which may or may not be 
used in the sampler. In particular, we have scripts to compare variations on the
sampling step for the occurrence probability and occurrence indicators: 

- Utils.R: contains functions for simulating frugivory data
- Blocked_indpt_PiOp.R: independently samples occurrence prob and indicators, block accept/rejects, no data aug
- Sequential_MH_PiOp.R: independently sequentially samples occurrence prob and indicators
- RW_blocked_PiOp.R: block samples occurrence prob and indicators with data aug, non adaptive proposal covariance
- AMH_PiOp.R: adaptive metropolis for block sampling of occurrence prob and indicators
- Test_seqVsblocked.R: compares only the sequential and blocked indpt samplers
- Test_all.R: compares all of the above

#' @param detected Matrix. Rows are species, columns are studies. Indicator of
#' whether the species were detected to be present in the given study. Derived
#' from the provided occurrence matrix, and checked against obs_A. Note that
#' while most studies only report interacting species, some studies do report
#' present but not interacting species. This often occurs when subsetting. 
#' @param occur_prior_probs Matrix.  Rows are species, columns are studies. 
#' It includes the user provided prior probabilities of occurrence
#' @param p_curr (Previously 'occur'). Matrix. Rows are species, columns are studies. 
#' It includes the probabilities of occurrence at the current step
#' @param occur_others Matrix Rows are species, columns are studies. It includes
#' the current values of occurrence for the other set of species, the ones that
#' are not being updated. 
#' @param probobs_curr Vector of current values for the probability of detection/
#' observation for the set of species we are updating.
#' @param probobs_others Vector of current values for the probability of detection/
#' observation for the other set of species, the ones that are not being
#' updated.
#' @param curr_inter Matrix with 0,1 entries for the current posterior samples
#' of possible interactions. The rows correspond to the species we are updating
#' and the columns correspond to the other set of species.
#' @param focus Array of three dimensions corresponding to the two sets of
#' species, and the different studies. Values are 0 or 1. This array represents
#' whether the current study would be willing to record the interactions of a
#' given species. The value should be 1 except for studies that are animal or
#' plant-oriented, where the value for species that are not of focus will be 0.

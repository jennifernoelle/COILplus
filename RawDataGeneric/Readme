The raw data folder includes multi-source anonymized interaction data,
excluding interactions that were not given at the species level for animals or plants, 
were not associated with a study. 

- frug_generic.csv- frugivory interactions with study ID, study site, country, zone, focus
  - Study_ID: identifies source
  - Study_IDplus
  - Animal and plant taxa type are more coarse groupings than family
-p_taxa_generic.csv, v_taxa_generic.csv: contain list of anonymized species

- Same site, different study
- Same country, diff everything else
- Same region

Trait cleaning: 
- Plants: we had 107 observations missing fruit width, 94 missing fruit length, 2 missing wood desnsity. 
  Where only fruit length is available, we impute width = length/ mean(length:width) if possible, 
  if not, then we use genus, family means. Genus and family means are used for wood density. 
- Verts: two species were missing generation length, we impute using genus and family means. 
Phylogenies: bird and mammal trees from VertLife

Focus considerations: 
- Animal (7618)
- Plant (817)
- Both (1639) - network studies, all interactions are recorded
- BothLimited (268) focuses on a limited number of plant and a limited number of animal species - in this case only interactions have Focus ==1
 because a chimp eating a mango could mean either mango or chimp or both was focal, conservative assumption.
